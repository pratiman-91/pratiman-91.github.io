## Description
IMDLIB is a python package to download and handle binary grided data from India Meteorological Department (IMD). For more information about the IMD datasets, follow the following link: http://imdpune.gov.in/Clim_Pred_LRF_New/Grided_Data_Download.html

## Installation
IMDLIB can be installed via pip. It is tested for both Windows and Linux platforms with 64-bit architecture only.

```bash
pip install imdlib
```

## Downloading data from IMD

IMDLIB is capable of downloading gridded rainfall and temperature data (min and max).
Here is an example of downloading rainfall dataset from 2010 to 2018.

```python
import imdlib as imd

# Downloading 8 years of rainfall data for India
start_yr = 2010
end_yr = 2018
variable = 'rain' # other options are ('tmin'/ 'tmax')
imd.get_data(variable, start_yr, end_yr, fn_format='yearwise')
```
### Output:

```python
Downloading: rain for year 2010
Downloading: rain for year 2011
Downloading: rain for year 2012
Downloading: rain for year 2013
Downloading: rain for year 2014
Downloading: rain for year 2015
Downloading: rain for year 2016
Downloading: rain for year 2017
Downloading: rain for year 2018
Download Successful !!!
```

The output is saved in the current working directory. If you want to save the files to a different directory, then you can use following code:

```python
import imdlib as imd

# Downloading 8 years of rainfall data for India
start_yr = 2010
end_yr = 2018
variable = 'rain' # other options are ('tmin'/ 'tmax')
file_dir = r'C:\Users\imdlib\Desktop\' #Path to save the files
imd.get_data(variable, start_yr, end_yr, fn_format='yearwise', file_dir=file_dir)
```
## Reading IMD datasets

One major purposes of IMDLIB is to process IMD's gridded dataset. The original data is available in ```grd``` file format. IMDLIB can read ```grd``` file in xarray style and will create a IMD class objetct.

```python
import imdlib as imd

# Downloading 8 years of rainfall data for India
start_yr = 2010
end_yr = 2018
variable = 'rain' # other options are ('tmin'/ 'tmax')
file_dir = r'C:\Users\imdlib\Desktop\' #Path to save the files
data = imd.open_data(variable, start_yr, end_yr,'yearwise', file_dir)
data
```

### Output:
```
<imdlib.core.IMD at 0x13e5b3753c8>
```
> file_dir should refer to top-lev directory. It should contain 3 sub-directories. rain, tmin, and tmax.

> if file_dir exist, but no subdirectory, it will try to find the files in file_dir. But be careful if you are using file_format = 'yearwise', as it will not differentiate between 2018.grd for rainfall and 2018.grd for tmin.

> if file_dir is not given, it will look for the associate subdirectories and files from the current directory.

## Processing with xarray

```python
ds = data.get_xarray()
ds 
```

### Output:
```
<xarray.DataArray 'rain' (lat: 129, lon: 135, time: 3287)>
...
...
...
Coordinates:
  * lat      (lat) float64 6.5 6.75 7.0 7.25 7.5 ... 37.5 37.75 38.0 38.25 38.5
  * lon      (lon) float64 66.5 66.75 67.0 67.25 67.5 ... 99.25 99.5 99.75 100.0
  * time     (time) datetime64[ns] 2010-01-01 2010-01-02 ... 2018-12-31
Attributes:
    long_name:  rainfall
    units:      mm/day
```

## Plotting Mean Rainfall
```python
ds.mean('time').plot()
```

### Output:
![{Mean Rainfall](/uploads/2020/10/06/Fig1.png)

## Saving to NetCDF
```python
save_nc = r'C:\Users\imdlib\Desktop\IMD_Rain_2010_2018.nc'
ds.to_netcdf(save_nc)
```
